            <p><big>The traditional problems (or goals) of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception and the ability to move and manipulate objects.
             AGI is among the field's long-term goals. Approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional symbolic AI.
              Many tools are used in AI, including versions of search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, probability and economics.
               The AI field draws upon computer science, information engineering, mathematics, psychology, linguistics, philosophy, and many other fields.

The field was founded on the assumption that human intelligence "can be so precisely described that a machine can be made to simulate it".
 This raises philosophical arguments about the mind and the ethics of creating artificial beings endowed with human-like intelligence. 
 These issues have been explored by myth, fiction and philosophy since antiquity.
  Some people also consider AI to be a danger to humanity if it progresses unabated.Others believe that AI, unlike previous technological revolutions, will create a risk of mass unemployment.

In the twenty-first century, AI techniques have experienced a resurgence following concurrent advances in computer power, large amounts of data, and theoretical understanding;
 and AI techniques have become an essential part of the technology industry, helping to solve many challenging problems in computer science,
  software engineering and operations</big></p>
