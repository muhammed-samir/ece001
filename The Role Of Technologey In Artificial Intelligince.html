            <p><big>As machines become increasingly capable, tasks considered to require "intelligence" are often removed from the definition of AI, a phenomenon known as the AI effect.
             A quip in Tesler's Theorem says "AI is whatever hasn't been done yet.
              For instance, optical character recognition is frequently excluded from things considered to be AI, having become a routine technology.
             Modern machine capabilities generally classified as AI include successfully understanding human speech, competing at the highest level in strategic game systems (such as chess and Go),
             and also imperfect-information games like poker, self-driving cars, intelligent routing in content delivery networks, and military simulations.</big></p>
